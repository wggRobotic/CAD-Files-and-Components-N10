# Robot components

Here you will find all the essential components of our robot available as .stl and .stp files, enabling anyone to build and modify the robot. Most of these components are designed for 3D printing and can be assembled using M3, M2.5, or M2 machine screws.

Material Recommendations:

  + Load-bearing components: PETG
  + Decorative/Chassis components: PLA (sufficient for parts that do not bear heavy loads)

Enjoy building and customizing your own robot!
